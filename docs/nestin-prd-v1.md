## Overview

We are building an online platform (similar to Airbnb) where people can rent homes or rooms for short or long stays. The platform connects **Hosts**, who want to list and rent out their properties, with **Guests**, who are looking for a place to stay—whether for vacation, work, or long-term living.

Our goal is to make the booking process smooth and easy for both sides.

## Our Customers

We have two main types of users: **Hosts** and **Guests**.

### Hosts

Hosts are people who own properties (like a house, apartment, or a single room) and want to rent them out. Many of them enjoy meeting people from different cultures and want to earn money by hosting travelers or long-term renters.

### Guests

Guests are people who are looking for a place to stay. Some are tourists who need a place for a few days, while others are looking for a longer stay. They use the platform to search, book, and enjoy a comfortable stay at a Host’s property.

## Experience (Key Features)

### Experience For Hosts

These are the main actions a Host (property owner) can do on the platform:

### Experience For Guests

These are the key actions a Guest (renter) can do on the platform:
