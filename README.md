## Setup

At first you need to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repo_url>
```

_Review Project File Structure [here](#file-structure)_.

### Prerequisites

- .NET SDK (version 9.0 or higher)
- Node.js (version 22 or higher)
- Angular CLI (version 19 or higher)
- SQL Server (for database)
- Visual Studio 2022 (For backend development)
- VS Code (For frontend development)

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory and find the `.sln` file.
2. Double-click the `.sln` file to open it in Visual Studio.
3. Restore the NuGet packages by right-clicking on the solution in the Solution Explorer and selecting "Restore NuGet Packages".
4. Set up necessary configurations in `appsettings.json` by filling the placeholders values with your own values. (fill `appsettings.development.json` instead of `appsettings.json` if you are using development environment)
5. Run the migrations to create the database schema. You can do this by running the following command in the Package Manager Console:

   ```bash
   Update-Database
   ```

6. Start the backend server by pressing `F5` or clicking on the "Start" button in Visual Studio.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Install the required packages by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the Angular development server by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200` to view the application.

**ðŸŒŸTip**: if you will do any changes on codebase, try to run `npm run format` before committing it to follow codebase formatting rules.

_Now your setup is ready! Enjoy Exploring the app!_
