Nestin is an online platform (similar to Airbnb) where people can rent homes or rooms for short or long stays. The platform connects **Hosts**, who want to list and rent out their properties, with **Guests**, who are looking for a place to stay whether for vacation, work, or long-term living.

## Setup

At first you need to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repo_url>
```

_Review Project File Structure [here](#file-structure)_.

### Prerequisites

- .NET SDK (version 9.0 or higher)
- Node.js (version 22 or higher)
- Angular CLI (version 19 or higher)
- SQL Server (for database)
- Visual Studio 2022 (For backend development)
- VS Code (For frontend development)

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory and find the `.sln` file.
2. Double-click the `.sln` file to open it in Visual Studio.
3. Restore the NuGet packages by right-clicking on the solution in the Solution Explorer and selecting "Restore NuGet Packages".
4. Set up necessary configurations in `appsettings.json` by filling the placeholders values with your own values. (fill `appsettings.development.json` instead of `appsettings.json` if you are using development environment)
5. Run the migrations to create the database schema. You can do this by running the following command in the Package Manager Console:

   ```bash
   Update-Database
   ```

6. Start the backend server by pressing `F5` or clicking on the "Start" button in Visual Studio.

#### Stripe Integration Setup

To enable payment functionality and support webhooks locally, you'll need to setup and configure the **Stripe CLI**.

##### Stripe Integration Prerequisites

- Ensure you have a [Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register).
- Install the [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli) for your operating system.

##### Stripe CLI Setup

1. Login to Stripe CLI
   Run the following command and follow the prompt to authenticate:

   ```bash
   stripe login
   ```

2. Forward Webhooks to Local Backend
   In a new terminal window, run the following command to forward Stripe webhook events to your local backend:

   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to https://localhost:7026/api/v1/Payments/stripe/webhook
   ```

3. Use the Webhook Secret key in Development Env Variables

   ```json
   "Stripe": {
    "SecretApiKey": "sk-your-api-key", // set your secret api key of stripe here
    "WebHookSecretKey": "whsec_...", // set your stripe webhook secrect key
    "SuccessUrl": "http://localhost:4200/home?paymentStatus=success", // The page URL used to redirect to it on success
    "CancelUrl": "http://localhost:4200/home?paymentStatus=canceled" // The page URL used to redirect to it on cancel
   }
   ```

4. Read More

   For detailed setup and additional usage, refer to the official Stripe documentation:
   ðŸ‘‰ https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Install the required packages by running the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the Angular development server by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200` to view the application.

**ðŸŒŸTip**: if you will do any changes on codebase, try to run `npm run format` before committing it to follow codebase formatting rules.

_Now your setup is ready! Enjoy Exploring the app!_
